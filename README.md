This tutorial will guide you through the process of building a simple weather app using Python and OpenWeatherMap API. <br>
Step 1: Sign up for OpenWeatherMap API <br>
To get started, you will need to sign up for OpenWeatherMap API. This will allow you to access weather data that you can use in your Python script. Simply head over to (https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up) and create a free account. Once you have created your account, navigate to your dashboard and generate an API key. You will need this key in order to access the weather data.<br>

Step 2: Install the Requests module<br>
The Requests module will be used to make HTTP requests to OpenWeatherMap API, so you will need to install it before proceeding. We will use the Requests module to make HTTP requests to OpenWeatherMap API. You can install the Requests module by running the following command in your terminal:<br>

Step 3: Import the Requests module and API key <br>
Now that we have installed the Requests module and generated our API key, we can start coding. Open a new Python file in your favorite code editor and import the Requests module: <br>
                                                ![image](https://github.com/SavvyChic42/Simple-Weather-App/assets/151141927/3077c5dc-a8c6-42b0-b31d-362053212224)<br>
Next, create a variable to store your API key:<br>
                                                 ![image](https://github.com/SavvyChic42/Simple-Weather-App/assets/151141927/b7c39937-cd0e-434a-b17d-9541620b5a05)<br>
Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual API key.<br>

Step 4: Build the weather app<br>
Now that we have imported the Requests module and stored our API key, we can start building our weather app. The app will prompt the user for a city name and use the Requests module to access weather data for that city.<br>

                                                                                                       Out Put
